# Algorithmic Trading in Python

This is a repo of 3 algorithmic "trading" projects. The data is collected from IEX (the free token version) that uses stock info from a fictional market that is similar to the real market. 

    1. Creates an equal weight S&P500 (as opposed to the actual S&P500's free-float market capitalization methodology)
    2. A quantitative momentum strategy that recommends stocks from the S&P500 with HQM and other metrics of quality momentum
    3. Quantitative value strategy that recommends stocks from the S&P500 using a variety of mettrics: RV score, PE ratio, PB ratio, PS ratio, ent. value, gross profit, etc.

All data is exported as an Excel file via xlxs writer
